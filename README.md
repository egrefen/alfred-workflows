Available Workflows
===================

MacVim
------

This assumes [MacVim](https://code.google.com/p/macvim/) is installed under `/usr/local/bin/mvim`. If it can't find that, it will back off to one of `/usr/bin/mvim`, `/usr/local/bin/gvim`, and finally `/usr/bin/gvim`.

This workflow allows you to open a file with MacVim (or just an empty buffer) by using one of the following keywords, followed by an optional argument (the path to the file):

* `macvim`
* `mvim`

Sublime Text
------------

This assumes [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) is installed in `/Applications`.

This workflow allows you to open a file with Sublime Text (or just an empty buffer) by using one of the following keywords, followed by an optional argument (the path to the file):

* `subl`
* `sublime`

Vim
------

This assumes [vim](http://www.vim.org/) is installed under `/usr/local/bin/vim`, or it will back off to `/usr/bin/vim`.

This workflow allows you to open a file with vim (or just an empty buffer) by using the keyword `vim` followed by an optional argument (the path to the file).
